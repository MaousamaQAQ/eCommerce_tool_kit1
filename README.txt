1. Before using any tool, please carefully read the README file in each folder.
2. Projects requiring internet access generally use web-crawling technologies. Most crawlers need maintenance every few months because webpage elements may change due to layout updates, new campaigns, or other adjustments. Therefore, if the program produces clearly incorrect results, stop using it immediately and have a specialist check and update the script. Local automation programs, since they do not require internet access, are less complex and generally carry no such risk. Programs using APIs also usually do not require frequent maintenance.
3. When using the programs, avoid opening or modifying files that store project configurations or parameters, such as csv or txt files. Doing so may affect data reading or writing and lead to program errors.
4. Please excuse the Chinese comments in the code. I wrote this project while in China, and there are too many lines for me to revise them all.
