This project is used to retrieve all data accessible under the account permissions from KLIKER via API.
Original files:
kliker.py
kliker1.py
Virtual environment: .venv
Folder containing the executables: dist

Daily operation staff should focus on the dist folder.
The dist folder contains:
kliker.exe - Used for querying data for the current day; double-click to run
kliker1.exe - Used for querying data for a specific time range; double-click to run
param.txt - Used to store parameters. The first line is the API key, the second line is the API request URL, the third line is the start date for the query, and the fourth line is the end date for the query
download folder - Used to store the output results generated by the exe files

Notes:
1. Do not query dates too far in the past, because KLIKER may not have collected our data for those dates
2. I have set a maximum of 5 retry attempts for errors. If the task still fails, it may be due to missing data or poor network conditions
