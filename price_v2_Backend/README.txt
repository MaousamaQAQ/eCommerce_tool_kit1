This project has the same function as price_v2.py, but it is designed specifically for backend data automation. Therefore, the UI has been removed, and it is fixed to crawl ASIN data from all 5 marketplaces each time. To use it, you need to place it on a virtual machine for automatic execution.

Usage:
1. Write a bat file to run price.py - it is recommended to use ChatGPT to generate it automatically
2. Use the Windows built-in "Task Scheduler" to run the bat file daily at a scheduled time.
